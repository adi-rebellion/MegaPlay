2014 Right Choice

As students we usually take things for granted without understanding what our parents go through to provide us with such luxuries. We usually turn a blind eye to the others around us and fail to understand their trials and tribulations. We usually believe that everything that happens is centred around us, whereas in reality it isn't. We are but pawns in God's grand plan and we must play our role in accordance to his will if we are to shine bright as a part of his final tapestry. The evil one is devious and may tempt us in ways we could never comprehend, but it is up to us to ask for God's intervention so that we may through his grace and make the Right Choice.
